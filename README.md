## Instructions
### Dependency
- Anaconda (Python >= 3.8)
### Data
The data for retweets can be downloaded from [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwqmV0EcoUc8UklIR1BKV25YR1U?resourcekey=0-OrlU87jyc1m-dVMmY5aC4w&usp=sharing)

The data for earthquakes and homicides can be downloaded from [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ELuYM9qIj2hoSzJcYAs9UklcwO2WdTNu?usp=sharing)
### Train

Training of 1-hidden for earthquakes
```
python earthquake_train_1_hidden.py
```
Traning of 2-hidden for earthquakes
```
python earthquake_train_2_hidden.py
```
You can do the same things for retweets and homicides.

### Test and prediction

For example, you can calculate the log-likelihood and do the prediction for 1-hidden for the first sequence with the following code. 0 represents the first sequence in the test dataset. 
You can replace 0 with another integer.
```
python earthquake_prediction_1_hidden.py -e 0
```
For 2-hidden,
```
python earthquake_prediction_2_hidden.py -e 0
```

After collecting the results for all the sequences, you can run the following code to get the results reported in the paper.
```
python prediction_result.py
```
